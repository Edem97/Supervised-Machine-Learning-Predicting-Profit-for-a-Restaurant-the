# Supervised-Machine-Learning-Predicting-Profit-for-a-Restaurant
Implementing linear regression learning model with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise.

# 2 -  Problem Statement
Assume you are the CEO of a restaurant chain and are researching potential locations or market niche for a new location.
- You would want to take your business to other areas where it can be more profitable for your restaurant.
- You have data on the chain's revenues and population statistics from the cities where it already has restaurants.
- Additionally, you have information about potential locations for a new restaurant.
- You have the population of these cities.

Based on this data a simple linear algorithm/model was designed to determine which cities could potentially yield bigger earnings for your company.

Have fun going through the project!
